# Car Dealership Console Application 2

## Description of the Project

The Car Dealership Application is a Java console program designed to help dealerships manage vehicle sales and lease contracts efficiently. This system allows users to create and manage different types of contracts — including sales contracts and lease contracts — based on customer information and vehicle data.

## User Stories


- As a user, I want to create a sales contract so that I can record vehicle purchases and calculate the total price and financing details. 
- As a user, I want to create a lease contract so that I can record vehicle leases and calculate monthly lease payments. 
- As a user, I want to input customer and vehicle data, so that the application can process it and generate a contract summary. 
- As a user, I want the system to automatically compute taxes and fees, so that I don’t have to calculate them manually. 
- As a user, I want clear feedback printed in the console, so that I understand the total cost and payment schedule.
